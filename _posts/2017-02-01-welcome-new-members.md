Welcome to Emily Weemees, Yana Pertels and Matthew Austin. Here to bring some neuroscience magic dust to our engineering madness.

Also, welcome Kristyn to your new position as team lead! Co-leading MINT with you will be the BEST!

All our parts for the OpenBCI are ordered, and we are starting assembly right away.
Manny hiccups with 3D printing, and assembling PCBs, but nothing that can’t be fixed by depending profusely on mentors.

NonPro-tip: If you aren’t bothering a grad student to death, you are doing it wrong.

May the gods of Manufacturing have mercy on us.
