NeurotechX launched their annual student team competition, and we are IN IT!!

It is composed of two challenges: The closed challenge (build an EEG system from scratch) and the open challenge (innovate with neurotech in any way).
As keeners, we decided to tackle both challenges together. How, you ask? By making an innovation that **requires** a simple EEG system built from scratch.

Our brainstorming technique was just accumulating buzzwords (in **bold**) of skillsets that we heard were employable, so we decided on:
An **EEG wearable** hairclip that is **user-centered**, and will collect **biomarkers**, then manage **user feedback** with a **phone app** to train **machine learning algorithms** and diagnose **ADD/ADHD**.

… I know, I am impressed too.

But in all honesty, this project aims to question the separation of a mental health diagnosis from a person’s life experience, and how tech may be useful.
Currently, we claim that a child is hyperactive based only on subjective observations from different adults at school, at home and at the psychologist office. Alternatively, we propose a wearable to collect objective EEG data throughout an otherwise normal week.
But for this to work, we must make it practically invisible, which means not requiring a PC at all times (so data is stored in phone), and being comfortable/subtle (user-centred).
Furthermore, to make the data analysis accurate for a user’s particularities, we must collect feedback on our predictions, which is done with the most accessibility through an ongoing tracker app.

May the gods of Market Validation have mercy on us.

All that said, here is Giulio preparing the board for a weekly meeting:
