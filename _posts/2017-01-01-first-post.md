Kickoff blog post!
HELLOOOOOOO WORLD

MINT is the new baby of UBC BEST (ubcbest.com) and let me tell you, we are KICKING.

Here is photographic evidence that we work hard, except for Giulio, who takes photos, and Bhaskar, who knows it.

Our aim right now: Form the basics of a team that can opperate in neurotech effectively.
How?
By getting right to work!
We will build this beautiful puppy, the Mach IV OpenBCI EEG headset. (openbci.com)

As an opensource tool, all the scary design work is done, so we get our hands dirty right away and learn as much as we can. Soon, we will be making our own designs, but the challenges will be more familiar and less agonizing (I hope).

May the gods of Cognition have mercy on us.
